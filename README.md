## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### API Endpoint: Create Payments

You can submit a batch of payments to the `POST /payments` endpoint.

**Example `curl` Request:**

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/payments \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "payment": {
    "company_id": 1,
    "payments": [
      {
        "employee_id": "E123",
        "bank_bsb": "062000",
        "bank_account": "12345678",
        "amount_cents": 500000,
        "currency": "AUD",
        "pay_date": "2024-10-28"
      },
      {
        "employee_id": "E456",
        "bank_bsb": "082000",
        "bank_account": "87654321",
        "amount_cents": 650000,
        "currency": "AUD",
        "pay_date": "2024-10-28"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

### Rake Task: Export Payments

To manually trigger the daily payment export job, run the following Rake task. This will query pending payments and generate a `.txt` file in the `/exports` directory.

```sh
rails exporter:run
```

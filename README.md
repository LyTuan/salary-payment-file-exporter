## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (version 3.3.4, preferably managed with a tool like `rbenv` or `asdf`)
*   Bundler
*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd salary-payment-file-exporter
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Ruby gems using Bundler.

```sh
bundle install
```

### 3. Start the Database

This project uses Docker Compose to manage the PostgreSQL database. Start the database container in the background:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Create and Set Up the Database

With the database container running, create, migrate, and seed your development and test databases.

```sh
# Create the databases
rails db:create

# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Seed the database with initial data (e.g., a default company)
rails db:seed
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the Rails server. By default, it will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
rails server
```

---

## ‚úÖ How to Run the Test Suite

This project uses RSpec for testing.

1.  **Prepare the Test Database:**
    Ensure your test database schema is up to date.
    ```sh
    rails db:test:prepare
    ```

2.  **Run All Tests:**
    Execute the entire test suite with the following command:
    ```sh
    bundle exec rspec
    ```

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance Testing

To ensure the application can handle a large volume of data, especially for the daily export job, performance testing tasks are included.

### 1. Seed Performance Data

First, populate the database with a large number of pending payments using the provided Rake task. You can specify the number of records to create using the `COUNT` environment variable.

```sh
# Example: Seed the database with 1,000,000 payment records
rails performance:seed COUNT=1000000
```

### 2. Run the Exporter Performance Test

Once the database is seeded, you can measure the performance of the export job. The `time` command will show the total execution time.

```sh
time bundle exec rails exporter:run
```

Monitor the memory and CPU usage of the process while it runs to identify potential bottlenecks.

### 3. Database Indexing for Performance

When working with large datasets, database indexes are critical for query performance. The `PaymentExporter` service relies on an efficient query to find pending payments.

To optimize this, we should add a composite index on the `status` and `pay_date` columns of the `payments` table.

**1. Generate the Migration:**

```sh
rails g migration AddIndexForExporterToPayments
```

**2. Edit the Migration File:**

Open the newly created migration file in `db/migrate/` and add the following code. Using the `concurrently` algorithm is essential for applying indexes to large tables in production without causing downtime.

```ruby
class AddIndexForExporterToPayments < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  disable_ddl_transaction!

  def change
    add_index :payments, [:status, :pay_date], algorithm: :concurrently
  end
end
```

**3. Apply the Migration:**

```sh
rails db:migrate
```

## üåä Workflows

Visual diagrams of the application's main processes, created with Mermaid.

### API Payment Creation Flow

This diagram illustrates the sequence of events when a client submits new payments to the `POST /payments` endpoint. It highlights the high-performance bulk-insert strategy which bypasses model validations in favor of speed, relying on database-level constraints for integrity.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant PaymentsController
    participant PaymentCreator
    participant Database

    Client->>+PaymentsController: POST /payments with JSON payload
    PaymentsController->>+PaymentCreator: call(company:, payments_attributes:)
    Note over PaymentCreator: Bypasses all model validations for performance.
    PaymentCreator->>+Database: INSERT INTO payments (...) [single bulk statement]
    
    alt Database constraints met
        Database-->>-PaymentCreator: Success
        PaymentCreator-->>-PaymentsController: Returns array of attribute hashes
        PaymentsController-->>-Client: 201 Created with success message
    else Database constraint violated (e.g., NOT NULL)
        Database-->>-PaymentCreator: Raises DB-level exception (e.g., ActiveRecord::NotNullViolation)
        PaymentCreator-->>-PaymentsController: Propagates DB exception
        Note over PaymentsController: Catches exception via 'rescue StandardError'
        PaymentsController-->>-Client: 400 Bad Request with error message
    end
```

### Daily Batch Export Flow

This diagram shows the process of the daily batch job (`exporter:run`), which is responsible for generating the payment file. The process is designed to be memory-efficient and transactional.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "Scheduler (e.g., Cron)"
    participant "RakeTask (exporter:run)"
    participant PaymentExporter
    participant Database
    participant FileSystem

    "Scheduler (e.g., Cron)"->>+"RakeTask (exporter:run)": Executes 'rails exporter:run'
    "RakeTask (exporter:run)"->>+PaymentExporter: new.export!
    
    PaymentExporter->>+Database: Finds pending payments (WHERE status=0 AND pay_date<=today)
    
    alt Payments found
        Database-->>PaymentExporter: Returns ActiveRecord::Relation

        PaymentExporter->>Database: BEGIN TRANSACTION
        Note right of PaymentExporter: 1. Creates ExportedFile record
        PaymentExporter->>Database: INSERT INTO exported_files
        
        Note right of PaymentExporter: 2. Generates .txt file in memory-efficient batches
        loop For each batch of 1000 payments
            PaymentExporter->>Database: SELECT ... FROM payments WHERE ... LIMIT 1000 OFFSET ...
            Database-->>PaymentExporter: Returns batch of records
        end
        PaymentExporter->>FileSystem: Writes file to /exports
        
        Note right of PaymentExporter: 3. Updates all found payments in a single query
        PaymentExporter->>Database: UPDATE payments SET status=1, exported_file_id=...
        
        Database-->>-PaymentExporter: COMMIT TRANSACTION
        
        PaymentExporter->>+FileSystem: Moves file from /exports to /outbox
        FileSystem-->>-PaymentExporter: Success
        
        Note over "RakeTask (exporter:run)": Logs success message to console
    else No payments found
        Database-->>-PaymentExporter: Returns empty relation
        Note over "RakeTask (exporter:run)": Logs 'No pending payments' and exits
    end
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### API Endpoint: Create Payments

You can submit a batch of payments to the `POST /payments` endpoint.

**Example `curl` Request:**

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/payments \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "payment": {
    "company_id": 1,
    "payments": [
      {
        "employee_id": "E123",
        "bank_bsb": "062000",
        "bank_account": "12345678",
        "amount_cents": 500000,
        "currency": "AUD",
        "pay_date": "2024-10-28"
      },
      {
        "employee_id": "E456",
        "bank_bsb": "082000",
        "bank_account": "87654321",
        "amount_cents": 650000,
        "currency": "AUD",
        "pay_date": "2024-10-28"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

### Rake Task: Export Payments

To manually trigger the daily payment export job, run the following Rake task. This will query pending payments and generate a `.txt` file in the `/outbox` directory.

```sh
rails exporter:run
```
